## A little history

### I made my first game at the end of 2021, when I started the second one, I abandoned it because of the complexity, but in February 2022 I returned and in the summer I began to grow rapidly in my knowledge of game development.
### At the moment I'm trying to learn more new things, I want to work in a game development studio, and even make my own under the name `HitStar` (so many people pronounce my nickname)

## I also do YouTube!
