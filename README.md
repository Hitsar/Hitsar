## A little history

I made my first game at the end of 2021, when I started the second one, I abandoned it because of the complexity, but in February 2022 I returned and in the summer I began to grow rapidly in my knowledge of game development.

## What is it now?

 At the moment I'm trying to learn more new things, I want to work in a game development studio, and even make my own under the name `HitStar` (so many people pronounce my nickname)
 
> [!NOTE]
> My nickname is 2 syllables and 6 letters **Hit Sar**.
